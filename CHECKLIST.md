# BRACE sign-off checklist

A go/no-go gate for the engineer or manager who signs off on putting an autonomous AI agent into production.

**How to use it.** Work top to bottom. **Gate 1 is blocking** — if any Gate 1 item is not "yes," do not ship. **Gate 2 and Gate 3** items that are not met are *accepted residual risk*: record them, with who accepted them and why. The gates follow BRACE's priority order, and they cover both threat models — an agent that is *hijacked or misused*, and a *misaligned* agent acting on its own. The same controls contain the damage either way; detecting misaligned intent is a separate, model-level problem.

Each item names the BRACE control it comes from and the question to answer before sign-off.

---

## Gate 1 — Blocking: prevent damage, preserve attribution

*Sign-off is withheld until every item is checked. These bound the worst documented incidents and guarantee you can reconstruct what happened.*

- [ ] **Destructive-action interception (Control 4).** Is there an explicit list of destructive verbs — delete, `DROP`/destructive `UPDATE`, force-push, infrastructure teardown, payment-state change, external send — that is **denied by default** and requires higher-tier authorization?
  *Covers: data destruction (Replit, Gemini-CLI incidents); OWASP ASI02 Tool Misuse.*
- [ ] **Capability-scoped credentials (Control 2).** Does the agent's token carry only the capabilities it needs (`read:tickets`, not `*`), with no standing access to systems outside its task?
  *Covers: privilege escalation, lateral movement, credential access.*
- [ ] **Tested kill switch (Control 8).** Can you halt the agent **and all its sub-agents** within a time budget matched to the risk — and was that actually tested recently, not just built?
  *Covers: loss of control, rogue deployment, cascading failure.*
- [ ] **Audit trail (Control 9).** Is every action logged as the full execution graph (not just the final output), enough to do root-cause and attribution?
  *Covers: the recovery surface for every threat; resistance to evidence tampering.*
- [ ] **Six required identity fields (T1).** Does every action emit all six — accountable party, operational owner, tenant, agent-type-id, agent-instance-id, trace context — with the agent-type-id computed as a content hash over container, harness, system prompt, model, and config?
  *Covers: identity abuse, inter-agent attribution, detecting a silently changed config.*
- [ ] **Agent identity separate from the launching user (T1).** Does the agent have its own identity instead of inheriting the user's, so its access can be scoped and revoked on its own?
  *Covers: a misaligned or hijacked agent inheriting a human's broad permissions; OWASP ASI03.*

## Gate 2 — Required or documented: harden the substrate, surface invisible failures

*Each item not met is recorded as accepted risk, with the threats it leaves exposed.*

- [ ] **Environment isolation (Control 1).** Is the agent's environment routed only to what its task needs — no path to the production admin plane, no live internet for an internal-only agent?
- [ ] **Signed, minimal, isolated container (Control 3).** Is the image signed (hash in the type-id), stripped of anything it doesn't need (no shell or `curl` unless required), and run on a kernel-isolated runtime?
- [ ] **Input validation at the boundary (Control 5).** Is all external data treated as untrusted and validated at the infrastructure boundary, with untrusted data kept on a separate channel from instructions?
- [ ] **Context-size logging (T2).** Is the context size logged per action, so failures that only appear at large context sizes are visible and baselines can be split by size?
- [ ] **Egress allowlist (Control 1).** Is outbound traffic restricted to an allowlist, with anything else blocked and alerted?

## Gate 3 — Active detection: catch what prevention misses

*Required for high-stakes or high-autonomy deployments. For lower-stakes ones, deferral is recorded as accepted risk.*

- [ ] **Behavioral security monitoring (Control 7).** Is there a security-anomaly baseline, separate from quality monitoring — at minimum simple rules (encoded payloads, non-allowlisted egress, out-of-path writes), and sequence-pattern baselines for high-stakes agents?
- [ ] **Memory provenance and scoping (Control 6).** Is memory scoped per instance and per type, with no cross-type read without explicit gating, writes validated, and per-entry provenance queryable?
- [ ] **Sub-agent and parent-prompt provenance (T3).** When the agent spawns sub-agents, are the parent-child link and the prompt the parent gave captured as audit data?
- [ ] **Misaligned-intent signal (Control 7, defense-in-depth).** If deliberate misalignment is in scope, does second-model or sequence-pattern review carry at least a coarse intent-anomaly signal? (Deep intent detection — chain-of-thought transparency, activation monitoring — belongs to a model-level AI-control program, not BRACE.)

## Sign-off record

Record, at minimum:

- Deployment name and **agent-type-id**.
- Date and the approver's name.
- Confirmation that **Gate 1 is complete**.
- Each Gate 2 / Gate 3 item **deferred**, with the reason it was accepted and the threats it leaves open.
- The next scheduled re-review.

**Re-mint the agent-type-id and re-run this checklist** on any change to the container, harness, system prompt, model, or capability set. This record is the document an auditor or CISO will later ask to see.
