# BRACE Framework — security for autonomous AI agents

**BRACE Framework** is a practical, vendor-neutral set of security controls for teams that build and operate autonomous AI agents — the kind that plan multiple steps, call tools and APIs, change real systems, and spawn sub-agents without a human reviewing each action.

It is built around one idea:

> An autonomous agent is not the code that shipped. It is a **runtime configuration** of infrastructure — a container, a harness (the loop that runs the model and hands it tools), a system prompt, a set of tools, a memory store, an identity, and a network path. Two agents built from the same model can behave completely differently depending on how those parts are configured. So you secure the **configuration**, not the code — there is no code to review.

BRACE names the controls over that configuration, says which to ship first, and specifies the data you need to log to operate them.

**BRACE stands for** the five concerns it organizes: **B**uild-time, **R**un-time, **A**gent, **C**onfiguration, **E**cosystem.

## Start here

- **[Sign-off checklist](CHECKLIST.md)** — a one-page go/no-go gate for the engineer or manager approving an agent for production. If you read one thing, read this.
- **[Self-assessment](SELF-ASSESSMENT.md)** — score an existing deployment, or use it as a question set when evaluating a vendor.
- **[The paper](#the-paper)** — the full framework, threat mappings, and a 35+ incident corpus.

## The framework in one screen

BRACE specifies **nine controls** and **three observability requirements**.

**Build-time controls** (fixed when the agent is built, frozen into the deployed artifact):

| # | Control | What it does |
|---|---------|--------------|
| 1 | Architecture | Environment and network isolation; bound the blast radius by topology, not good behavior. |
| 2 | Capability-scoped API access | Tokens grant specific capabilities (`read:tickets`, not `*`); least privilege. |
| 3 | Container | Signed, minimal, kernel-isolated image; the image hash is part of the agent's identity. |
| 4 | Harness | The highest-leverage control: which tools, which arguments, which limits — and **destructive-verb interception** (delete, drop, wipe blocked by default). |

**Run-time controls** (active on every execution):

| # | Control | What it does |
|---|---------|--------------|
| 5 | Data | Treat all external input as untrusted; validate at the boundary; assume prompt injection sometimes succeeds. |
| 6 | Memory | Scope memory per instance and per type; validate writes; keep provenance per entry. |
| 7 | Behavioral | Security-anomaly monitoring (distinct from quality monitoring): evasion, privilege escalation, multi-step composed attacks. |

**Closure controls** (stop and explain):

| # | Control | What it does |
|---|---------|--------------|
| 8 | Kill Switch | A *tested* way to halt the agent and its sub-agents within a risk-matched budget, leaving a safe state. |
| 9 | Audit Trail | The full execution graph for every action — not just the final output. |

**Observability requirements** (the data the controls above depend on — not separate defenses):

| # | Requirement | What it adds |
|---|-------------|--------------|
| T1 | Required identity fields | Six fields on every action (below). |
| T2 | Context-size logging | The context size at decision time, so baselines can be split by context-size range. |
| T3 | Sub-agent & parent-prompt provenance | Which sub-agent ran, and the prompt the parent gave it. |

**Every control and observable has two halves.** An *agent-scoped* half (configured per agent type) and an *ecosystem-scoped* half (a property of the shared substrate every agent runs on). You cannot secure one half alone: an agent cannot present a narrowly scoped token unless the identity system can issue one.

### The six required identity fields (T1)

Every action carries: **accountable party**, **operational owner**, **tenant**, **agent-type-id**, **agent-instance-id**, and **trace context**. (Optional: region, trust domain.)

The **agent-type-id** is a content hash — a fingerprint — over the container digest, harness, system prompt, model id, and config. Any change to the agent produces a new id, so a silently changed configuration is detectable. See **[otel-conventions.md](otel-conventions.md)** for the proposed OpenTelemetry attribute keys (`agent.type.id`, `agent.instance.id`, `agent.context.size`, `agent.parent.prompt`).

## What to ship first

Most teams cannot build all twelve elements at once, and should not wait until they can. The priority order:

- **Tier 1 — prevent damage, preserve attribution.** Harness destructive-verb interception (Control 4), capability-scoped tokens (Control 2), a tested kill switch (Control 8), an audit trail (Control 9), and the six identity fields (T1). This bounds the worst incidents and guarantees you can reconstruct what happened.
- **Tier 2 — harden the substrate, surface invisible failures.** Architecture/egress isolation (Control 1), a signed and minimal container (Control 3), input validation (Control 5), context-size logging (T2).
- **Tier 3 — active detection.** Behavioral monitoring with sequence-pattern baselines (Control 7), memory provenance and scoping (Control 6), sub-agent and parent-prompt provenance (T3).

Adopting only part of BRACE means you are accepting the rest of the risk **on purpose**, not removing it.

## How BRACE relates to OWASP, NIST, and MITRE

BRACE is **not** a replacement for the frameworks you already use. The field's own consensus in 2026 is that no single framework is complete, and the missing piece is concrete, agent-granular controls. That is the gap BRACE fills, and it is designed to **compose** with the rest:

- **OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications** — a threat catalog. BRACE maps each of its ten risks (ASI01–ASI10) to the controls that mitigate them.
- **MITRE ATLAS** — an attacker-technique catalog. BRACE maps the agentic techniques to controls.
- **NIST AI RMF / ISO 42001** — governance and compliance. BRACE is the technical control layer underneath the governance.

Use OWASP and MITRE to know *what can go wrong*. Use BRACE to know *what to build and in what order*.

### What BRACE adds that the others don't specify

Five concrete requirements that existing frameworks leave abstract:

1. Treat the **harness, system prompt, and built-in tools** as hardening artifacts — versioned, diff-reviewed, distinct from the external tool surface. This is where destructive-verb interception lives.
2. **Six required identity fields** on every action, including the content-hashed agent-type-id.
3. **Context-size logging** at decision time, with baselines split by context-size range.
4. **Sub-agent and parent-prompt provenance** as a first-class field — separating "the sub-agent misbehaved" from "the parent prompted it badly."
5. **Infrastructure-as-code drift detection** applied at agent granularity (container, harness, MCP server list, system prompt, network policy).

## Two threat models, one containment layer

BRACE was built for the **hijacked-or-misused agent** — an agent manipulated by prompt injection, a poisoned tool, or a supply-chain compromise. It also contains the **misaligned-insider** model (the model itself acting as a deliberate adversary), because containment does not depend on *why* an agent went rogue: a scoped token, an egress allowlist, and a tested kill switch bound the damage either way.

What BRACE does **not** do is detect misaligned *intent* inside otherwise-authorized behavior (alignment faking, sandbagging). That is a model-and-monitoring problem — the domain of AI control work such as Google DeepMind's AI Control Roadmap. BRACE is the containment layer; AI control is the detection layer; the two compose.

## Status and honesty

BRACE is a **synthesis of agent-security practice already in production** across the industry — not yet a validated standard. The individual controls are widely deployed; what BRACE adds is the unified organization and the agent-granularity instrumentation. The integrated framework has not yet been measured against a control group. It is an open, evolving project — apply it, critique it, and contribute (see **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)**).
